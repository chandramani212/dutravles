This new city hotel, Lisbon's first design hotel, is a new departure owing to its concept and location. It is conveniently located in Belém, at the heart of Lisbon's major monuments and museums. This urban resort incorporates three colours into its contemporary design: an exciting chocolate brown, stimulating carmine red and a relaxing cream colour, all of which combine to incite surprising feelings of harmony and tranquillity in an increasingly cosmopolitan Lisbon. The quality of the service will add a touch of refinement that is expected of most cultural and social events. Guests are welcomed into the hotel lobby at this air-conditioned establishment, which features 24-hour reception and check-out services, a hotel safe and lift access. Further facilities include a hairdressing salon, bar and a restaurant. Internet access is available, and conference facilities are provided for business guests.
